#In this file you can override default module group for your extensions. Add a property <modulename>.group.override and as a value group name. if you use subgroups use / as a separator. for example myextension.group.override=mygroup/mysubgroup. It is recommended to keep custom hybris modules within custom group i.e. custom/subgroup so that the generated search scopes would function correctly.
